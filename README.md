# 👋 Welcome to Hex & Logs

Hi, I'm **Hamza** – a cybersecurity enthusiast at the beginning of my journey into the world of security operations, threat hunting, and all things defense and offense.

## 🎯 What I'm Learning

I'm currently exploring:

- **SOC analysis** – detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents  
- **Blue team operations** – defensive techniques, log analysis, and threat detection  
- **Red team & penetration testing** – understanding attack techniques to build better defenses  
- **Digital forensics** – investigating incidents and reconstructing what happened  
- **Threat hunting** – proactively searching for threats using logs and SIEM-style tools  

## 🛠️ What I'm Building

This repository powers my GitHub Pages site and acts as my learning lab. Here I plan to share:

- Small security projects and hands-on labs  
- Write-ups from challenges and practice scenarios  
- Notes on tools, techniques, and concepts I discover along the way  
- My progress as I grow in the cybersecurity field  

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm here to learn, share knowledge, and meet people who are passionate about cybersecurity.  
If you’re interested in SOC work, blue/red teaming, forensics, or threat hunting, I’d be happy to connect, exchange ideas, and get inspired by your experience.

> I read **logs** so attackers don't write the **story**.
