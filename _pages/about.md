Driven by curiosity and a passion for cybersecurity, I specialize in threat detection, SOC analysis, and digital forensics. With hands-on experience spanning security automation, incident response, and advanced log analysis, I thrive on breaking down complex attacks, building resilient defenses, and exploring the latest tools in the infosec field. 

My journey is powered by continuous learning, practical experimentation, and a commitment to sharing knowledge—whether through labs, LinkedIn content, or community engagement. 

Welcome to a space where incident response meets innovation, and where every challenge is a chance to grow.
